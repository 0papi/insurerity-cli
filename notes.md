# Introduction
This is a CLI application for generating frontend applications to be used 
at my company - Insurerity  Digital. Right now the application will support
only two frontend frameworks: React and Angular. Upon 
launching the CLI, there will be an introduction and then
a prompt to select the framework of choice.
